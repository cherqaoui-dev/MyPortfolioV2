I'm a curious, self-motivated Software Developer based in [Casablanca, Morocco](https://www.google.com/search?q=casablanca+Morocco).

Driven by the skill of acquiring new skills, I seek to learn and apply my experience in applications design, development and maintenance in order to transform an idea into a working ready to use product. A good communicator and team player.
